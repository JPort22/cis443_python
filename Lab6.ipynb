    "**Exercise 6.7, p. 235 (Character Counts)** Recall that strings are sequences of characters. Use techniques similar to **Fig. 6.2** to write a script that inputs a sentence from the user, then uses a dictionary to summarize the number of occurrences of each letter. Ignore case, ignore blanks, and you assume the user does not enter any punctuation (or you can just count the characters that are letters). Display a two-column table of the letters and their counts with the letters in sorted order. Finally, use a `set` operation to determine which letters of the alphabet were not in the original string and print this result, as well. Test your source code and save your work before submission.<br>\n",
    "**Hint**: It will be helpful to have a string variable with all the lowercase or uppercase letters to determine which letters of the alphabet were not in the entered string. Luckily, Python provides such strings in the `string` module as <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.ascii_lowercase\" target=\"_blank\">`string.ascii_lowercase`</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.ascii_uppercase\" target=\"_blank\">`string.ascii_uppercase`</a>. Then you can use set difference to answer this question.\n"
